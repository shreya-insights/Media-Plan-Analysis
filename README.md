# Campaign Performance Data

This repository contains an analysis of campaign performance based on weekly ad spends, estimated sales, and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS).

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes:
- **Weekly budget allocation (%)**
- **Ad spends and estimated sales for each week**
- **ROAS calculations**
- **Per-day spend and revenue insights**
- **Visual representation of Weekly Spends vs. Sales and ROAS trends**

## 🔍 Key Insights:
- **ROAS remains constant at 2** across all weeks.
- The highest **ad spend and revenue were observed in Week 22nd to 28th**.
- Some inefficiency is noticed in **Week 8th to 14th**, where the proportional relationship between spend and sales is weaker.
- **Week 22nd to 28th had the most effective budget utilization**.
- 📌 **Recommendation:** Increase **budget allocation for Week 22nd to 28th** to maximize returns.


💡 **Future Improvements:**  
- Automate weekly ROAS tracking using Python  
- Add interactive visualizations using GoogleSheets
